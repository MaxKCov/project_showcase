This Python script allows you to quickly swap BUSD for a token of your choice in a BUSD-paired liquidity pool on PancakeSwap. Prior to running, provide your wallet address to the "pancakeswapbuyBUSD.py" (sender_address variable) and your wallet address private key to "PK.py" (PK variable). Input the desired parameters (BUSD swap quantity, gas limit, gas price) into the function (default: 100 BUSD, 1500000, 20, respectively, configured for fast buy). After running the script, input the contract address of the token you would like to swap your BUSD for.
